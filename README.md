## CBLiP
Pytorch implementation of CBLiP- a connection-biased transformer model for KG link prediction.

To run KG Link Prediction experiments on the datasets:

- Choose a task and go to the subdirectory TRP for transductive relation prediction and IEP for inductive entity prediction
- Install the requirements using the `requirements.txt` file for that particular task (TRP/IEP)
- Open file `run.sh`
- Uncomment the line corresponding to the dataset you want to run
- Run the command `bash run.sh` in your command line.
